dash too quick
verticle momentum maintained during dash
hold jump to vary jump height
if shadow gets within a certain distance, dashes forwards
shadow next position = player position plus player momentum
limiters on shadow speed at times

-The options menu does not work, so I couldn't adjust volume, so I just muted the whole application instead.
-That high pitched screech when the dash recharges is really annoying, opt for something less piercing, or for visual cues
-You can get a 3rd jump if you walk off a ledge and jump, then you can do another midair jump, despite there only being one midair jump available.
-The shadow cannot kill you if you just keep holding an arrow key on flat ground
-There is a segment where you must doublejump>dash and theres no way to get over the gap, making it really annoying when you reach the gap with no dashes
-There is no way to hasten dash recharge, making the gap worse
-The character selection are different pixel sizes, making it jarring
-The character is a bit too floaty
-Theres no backstory or why or how the game starts

crystally pedistal sprite instead of campfire
collect crystals around the place to bring back to main crystal pedistal and make the light brigter and keep the shadow away.
